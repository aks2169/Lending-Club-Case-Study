# Lending-Club-Case-Study

Case study assignment by Upgrad and IIIT-B

This case study is more focused on EDA methodologies, which help us to understand which parameters can be taken into consideration to find whether a borrower will default a loan or not. 
We have uploaded a PPT as well to illustrate the major parameters to consider while giving loans.

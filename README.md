## General Information
- Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 

- Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 

- The purpose of this case study is to understand  and identify potential risky loan applicants, so that  loan applications from such applications can be rejected and thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss incurred by charged off loans.

- We are using the dataset provided by Lending club, that has the details of all loans issued from 2007 till 2011.

## Conclusions
After analysis some of the major factors in the data provided. We can provide the following suggestions to Lending Club, to help them approve or reject forthcoming loan applications
- Borrowers whose loan purpose is small business, their probability of repaying increase as the grade gets poor.
- Restrict the number of loans provided to people from the states CA, FL and NY.
- Double verify when the borrowers are on rent and in states ID, DC and HI
- Borrowers whose property is on mortgage and the property is in states DE, MI, MT, NE, NH, WV and WY
- Have more credit history investigations before providing loans to people who have 3 to 13 open credit lines
- Have additional screening of applications if the grading is B, C, D or E.
- Stop or reduce the number of loans taken for the purpose of debt consolidation
- Avoid giving loans to people who have rented, or mortgage houses and loan purpose is education, home improvement and moving.
